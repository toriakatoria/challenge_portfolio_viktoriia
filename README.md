# Task 1: software configuration
## ‚ÄúSubtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?‚Äù

Hello, my name is Viktoriia and I'm thankful for the chance to take part in this challenge.
I've been a part of IT Support team for several years and in IT field one never stops learning.
Though tons of information can be found on internet, like learning videos, blogs, channels, sites about testing and programming I'm eager to learn something from real people. 
And what's more important, to get feedback and discuss some problems with other newbies.

And yeah, I've never worked with Python, Pycharm, looking forward to explore it.

 ~~I'm not boring, just used to be a teacherüòÅ~~
 
Have a nice day!
